        The last cottages of the older Old Wolverton village on the north side of the road before the
        Galleon Estate took on the name. This view across the rectory garden towards the church and rectory
        is likely taken from the original Old Wolverton Road that joined Stratford Road near Wolverton Park
        House, the road is now called Mill End and part of the MK redway system. With the cottages gone,
        the same view today would be obscured by tree growth.
