        Looking east along Stratford Road, at the junction with Jersey Road. The two shops
        in the picture are now combined into a single convenience store. The one on the
        corner was The CandyBox for many years and the smaller shop next door was Pedley's
        the barbers for many decades after this pre-WWII photo was taken. Out of shot
        on the other corner of Jersey Road, Page's garage had petrol pumps with a rotating
        arm to carry the filler pipe over the pavement.
