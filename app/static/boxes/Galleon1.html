        We know this pub as The Galleon today, but it was called The Locomotive when this photo was taken,
        reflecting the importance of the local railway industy. It was built at the same time at the canal
        and originally names "The Wharf", as it stands in front of the canalside wharf. The bridge was
        replaced in the 1960s when the Old Wolverton Road was developed for industry following a decline
        in the Wolverton Railway Works. The footpath along the top of the canal embankment was usable until
        quite recently, although the embankment was overgrown. Some residents of Longville have taken
        their part of the embankment as extentions to their back gardens.
