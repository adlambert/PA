        This photo was taken from the point where Creed St meets Stratford Road, towards the west.
        At the time, the photographer would have been looking out of an upstairs window of a
        terraced house at the end of Creed Street, now in the car park for Glyn Square/Asda.
        On the left behind the wall was the former school that became a market hall after the
        new schools opened around 1905. This is now the Town Council offices / Library.
        The tall flagpole tops the Royal Engineer (Antep). The mighty building on the right
        was the works dining hall which made way for Tesco in the 1990s.
        The lines of barrows attended by children carried food brought for workers lunches,
        pushed from all over Wolverton and up the station hill from New Bradwell. The
        length of shadows in this photo suggest this is lunchtime.
