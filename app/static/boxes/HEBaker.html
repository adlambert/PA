        This is Church Street looking west from the Radcliffe Street crossroads. H.E.Baker tailor
        shop on the corner became a Building Society office, with local newspaper offices behind, more
        recently it's the home of Bubbles launderette. The building was replaced by a similarly shaped
        newer one around the time that the Agora was built. The bunting and flags are possibly for the
        coronation of George V, 1910.
