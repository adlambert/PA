        Looking West along Stratford Road from the Anson Road junction. The long building on the
        north side of Stratford Road is part of McCorquodale printers who set up a factory
        in Wolverton following an arrangement between Richard Moon of the railway company
        and George McCorquodale to provide a ready workforce for the printing company
        and employment for the unmarried young ladies of the area. Buildings were continually
        added and updated on both sides of the Stratford Road from 1878, at its peak "The Print"
        employed around a thousand people.<br />This building was demolished in 1988 and replaced by
        car showrooms and forecourts.
