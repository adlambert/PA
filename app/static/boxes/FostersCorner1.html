        Looking to the east here a view of the Radcliffe Street junction with Stratford Road, known as Fosters Corner
        because for many years the shop on the corner was a branch of Fosters Menswear. Some might remember the vertical
        feature behind the man standing on the opposite corner was a full length mirror that pedestrians crossing the
        road could admire themselves in. The version of the locomotive pulling the tram suggests this photo is around 1910.
