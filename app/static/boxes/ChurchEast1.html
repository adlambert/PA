        Looking to the west along Church Street from a viewpoint close to where the Agora outside space is now,
        roughly the position of the old Empire Cinema, now a carpet and furniture shop. The shops on the near
        left were demolished for the Agora. The taller building on the right of Church Street near the centre
        of the photograph is the Queen Victoria on the corner of Radcliffe Street. Probably a 1910 photograph,
        with bunting and flags for the coronation of King George V.
