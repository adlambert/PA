        From Radcliffe Street looking east along Church Street towards the Little Streets.
        The building on the left covered in Ivy adjoins the Queen Victoria, and most of the
        row of bay windows above the shopfronts with awnings are gone, though today the
        brickwork gives away where they were. Buildings along the right hand side were
        demolished, mostly in the 1970s, to make way for the Agora.
