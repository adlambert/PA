        The original war memorial erected in the Square after World War One, stood until the 1990s when it was
        replaced after the soft stone material had decayed beyond repair. This is the site of every Remembrance
        Sunday ceremony in Wolverton. Many of us who had a childhood in the town will have been chastised for
        climbing on those steps. The building behind is the "Congs" congregational church on the Aylesbury street
        end was there until it was replaced by a supermarket in the 1970s. Now returned to church use.
        This photo was a postcard that was sent to Northampton and has a postmark 24th August 1926.
