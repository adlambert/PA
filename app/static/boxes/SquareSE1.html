        From the south eastern corner of the Square, junction with Aylesbury Street, the view straight
        down Radcliffe Street to Stratford Road was possible before the Agora landed in the late 1970s.
        Now known as "The Square", it was Market Square and in fact the street sign on the opposite corner
        still says Market Square today. The middle of the square, which may have accommodated some market
        stalls here is surrounded by railings which would have been taken for use in ordnance in one of
        forthcoming wars. In exchange the Square gained a war memorial. The buildings on this side of The Square
        started out as residential and converted to retail progressively over the decades.
