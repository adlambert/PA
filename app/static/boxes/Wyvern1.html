        Designed by architects Messrs Harrington,Ley Kirkham & Partners of Bishopsgate Without, London.
        This grand building stands out proudly above the surrounding terraces. Originally a school for
        girls and infants. This view taken from undeveloped land at the north end of Peel Road, you can
        see the children in the bottom left of the photo are only visible from the waist up. This was
        how the area was landscaped until the new houses were built on Peel Road in the 1980s. A metal building
        was put up on this land in the 1930s, acting as an extension to the school, with sports facilities
        including a long jump sandpit and tennis courts. The metal building was used by the Ministry of
        Food in WWII, dealing with ration books, and a robust air raid shelter was added for the staff.
