        Possibly a 1920s view judging by the vehicles and telegraph wires. Looking west along
        Stratford Road from outside the Royal Engineer (Antep Kitchen), the railings on the right
        were one floor up on the Works offices, equivalent to the drop down to Tesco car park
        level today. The first building on the right was the Work fire station. Across the
        road, Muscutt & Tompkins was still a newsagent until lately becoming an estate agent office.
